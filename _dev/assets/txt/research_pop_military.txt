In the period between 1300 and 1500 not every men-at-arms (fully armed and typically mounted soldier) was of the knightly class. At this time Knight was more of a social class associated with the richer landowning gentry. At the bottom of this gentry class sat those who had manor or estate that provided them with an annual revenue of 20–25 English pounds (About 4–5 times the annual income of a trained city craftsman).

You could generally become a knight if your annual revenue was around 40 English pounds or the continental equivalent. Because of various legal and political duties attached to the position many simply chose not to become Knights. This to the point that some kings started taxing or fining these people who were eligible to become Knights but didn’t actually take the “promotion”.

Man-at-arms was the catch all term for fully armored mounted soldiers at this time and they were largely drawn from the gentry and knights. The latter typically received a slightly higher pay and seems to have served in NCO/Officer positions more often, but by the end of the period this pay distinction was done away.

The proportion of knights among the men-at-arms varied through time. Between the 1280s and 1360s, figures between 20-30% were commonplace. Thereafter, there was a rapid decline, with the figure dropping to 6.5% in 1380. A slight rise is recorded to 8% at Agincourt, perhaps because this was a royal army, but thereafter the figure continued to decline and by 1443, the Duke of Somerset mustered only 1.3% knights among his men-at-arms

In one of the clashes between France and Burgundy the latter had some trouble:

The whole number of our horse was, I believe, not above 1200, and of them scarce fifty understood how to lay a lance in rest


 For the French it seems bringing between 10.000 and 20.000 men-at-arms to the battlefield was the very maximum with the number being closer to 10.000.
