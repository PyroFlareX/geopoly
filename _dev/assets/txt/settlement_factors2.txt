So about the game, there are 3 kinds of entities in the game: civilizations (=players), settlements and armies. Should the following attributes be hidden from other players:

- Settlement's population (there are many other factors that contribute to this number, those would be private)
- Settlement's composition of nations
- Army's morale
- Army's amount of units
- Army's composition of nations
