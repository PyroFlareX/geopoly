Geopoly game design


1) Clarity
  - show user who is enemy
    declared war
  - who is ally
    sealed alliance (using dynasty)
  - toggle player names over units
  - toggle country flags over units

  - toggle country / player coloring

2) satisfaction
  = feedback to player actions
    + reward

    5 Excellent
      +25xp extra
    10 Undefeated

  sounds:
    - battle attack
       victory
       defeat

3) style
  - make unit sprites, portraits and icons consistent somehow!

    - allies
    - online players
    - chat
    - date of server
    - my country & units
